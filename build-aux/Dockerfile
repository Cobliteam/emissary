# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.3

###
# This dockerfile builds all the source code and docker images for the
# edge stack.
##

###
# How it works.
##
# All our source code is built in a single monolithic build
# container. (The "builder" stage below.) We then produce optimized
# release images by copying the specific binaries and entrypoints out
# of the build container. The build container must always contain all
# the binaries and entrypoints for any container we produce, and
# therefore (with the appropriate entrypoint) can function in place of
# any release container. The release containers are trivial stages
# that simply copy the relevant artifacts out of the builder
# container.

# This argument controls the base image that is used for the release
# containers.
ARG base="i-forgot-to-set-build-arg-base"

# This argument sets the base image for the build container image. This
# base image contains only third-party code.
ARG builderbase="i-forgot-to-set-build-arg-builderbase"

# This controls where we copy envoy from.
ARG envoy="i-forgot-to-set-build-arg-envoy"
